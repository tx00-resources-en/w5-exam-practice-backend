# Labs Overview

This repository contains **three labs** for creating API servers with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations:

- **Book API**
- **Product API**
- **Job API**

Each lab is located in its own folder ([`book-api`](./book-api/README.md), [`product-api`](./product-api/README.md), [`job-api`](./job-api/README.md)).

For each lab:
- You will find **step-by-step instructions** in the `README.md` file inside the respective folder.
- Each step also points to a **sample solution** for that step.

Follow the instructions in each lab's README to build the API server and complete the CRUD functionality.
