# Labs Overview

This repository contains **three labs** for creating API servers with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.


Each lab is located in its own folder (`book-api`, `product-api`, `job-api`).


- [**Book API**](./book-api/README.md)
- [**Product API**](./product-api/README.md)
- [**Job API**](./job-api/README.md)

For each lab:
- You will find **step-by-step instructions** in the `README.md` file inside the respective folder.
- Each step also points to a **sample solution** for that step.

Follow the instructions in each lab's README to build the API server and complete the CRUD functionality.
